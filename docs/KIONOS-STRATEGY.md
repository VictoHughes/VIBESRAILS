### Brand Positioning

```
KIONOS™ = The vibes development company

What we do:
- Build tools that protect your flow state
- Keep coding fast while staying secure
- No interruptions, just guardrails

Target audience:
- Developers who code in flow (vibes)
- Teams using AI coding tools (Claude, Cursor, Copilot)

🧵 1/8

Launching KIONOS™ - the vibes development company

First tool: VibesRails 🛤️

You code in flow (vibes).
Your tools should protect it, not break it.

VibesRails keeps you secure without interrupting your momentum.

⭐ github.com/KIONOS/vibesrails

👇

---

2/8

The problem:

You're in flow, shipping features fast.
Claude/Cursor helping you move at 10x speed.

Then: "SECRET LEAKED ON GITHUB"
Or: "SQL INJECTION IN PRODUCTION"

Your flow state? Destroyed.
Your weekend? Debugging disasters.

There has to be a better way.

---

3/8

VibesRails = Security guardrails that don't break your vibes

✅ Catches issues BEFORE commit
✅ Blocks hardcoded secrets
✅ Prevents SQL/shell injections
✅ Enforces architecture rules
✅ Works with Claude Code/Cursor
✅ Zero config to start

It's like having a security engineer pair with you, silently.

---

4/8

Real impact (from my own usage):

Before VibesRails:
→ 3 secrets leaked to GitHub (😱)
→ 2 SQL injection bugs in production
→ Weekends spent firefighting

After VibesRails:
→ 0 secrets leaked (caught at commit)
→ 0 injection bugs (blocked before push)
→ Weekends spent shipping

---

5/8

How it works:

1. Install: `pip install vibesrails`
2. Setup: `vibesrails --setup` (2 min)
3. Code: Git hook scans every commit
4. Protected: Issues blocked before they ship

That's it.

No servers, no accounts, no BS.
Pure vibes, pure security.

---

6/8

Best part: It's FREE and open source (MIT)

Why?

Because keeping developers in flow shouldn't cost money.
Because security tools should be accessible.
Because the dev community gave me so much.

This is KIONOS's first tool.
More vibes tools coming.

---

7/8

Built by a developer who:
- Got tired of broken flow states
- Spent too many weekends fixing preventable bugs
- Believes tools should serve you, not interrupt you

KIONOS = Tools that respect your vibes ✨

### Show HN Post

**Title:** Show HN: VibesRails – Security scanner that doesn't break your flow

**Body:**
```
Hey HN,

I built VibesRails after leaking my third API key to GitHub in as many months.

The problem wasn't lack of tools. It was that security tools either:
1. Interrupt your flow (manual reviews, slow scans)
2. Trigger after it's too late (GitHub alerts)
3. Are enterprise-bloated (features you'll never use)

I wanted something that:
- Catches issues before commit (not after)
- Works silently (no flow interruption)
- Just works (zero config)

VibesRails does three things well:
1. Scans every commit automatically
2. Blocks hardcoded secrets, injections, etc.
3. Integrates with Claude Code/Cursor

It's saved me probably 50+ hours of bug fixing in the last 6 months.

It's free, open source (MIT), and takes 2 minutes to set up.

Try it: github.com/KIONOS/vibesrails

Would love feedback, especially on:
- Patterns you'd want added
- False positive rate
- Developer experience

Thanks!
```

### Email Newsletter Template

**Subject:** "Keeping your vibes alive while shipping secure code"

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick update from KIONOS:

This week we:
- Added 10 new security patterns
- Fixed the FastAPI false positive
- Hit 1000 GitHub stars 🎉

One user story that made my week:

"VibesRails caught a hardcoded AWS key I was about to commit.
Saved me hours of key rotation + potential security breach.
This tool pays for itself instantly."

That's exactly why we built this.

What's next:
- Team features (config sharing)
- Analytics dashboard
- More framework patterns

Keep shipping in vibes 🚀

Stan @ KIONOS

P.S. If VibesRails saved you this week, consider supporting:

## Risk Mitigation

   - Differentiation: Free, simple, AI-friendly

3. **Burnout**
   - Mitigation: Sustainable pace, community help
   - Plan: Start hiring at $5k MRR

4. **Revenue too slow**
   - Mitigation: Multiple revenue streams
   - Backup: Consulting/services to bootstrap
